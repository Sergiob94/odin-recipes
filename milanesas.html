        <h4>What on earth milanesas are?</h4>
        <p>Milanesa is a humble, yet delicious meal <em> of a breaded slice of prime beef that is fried in hot oil</em>, curling up as it cooks, due to the fact that the chosen cuts of meat have <strong>less fat and sinew</strong> than other cuts.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>top round steaks thinly sliced/pounded to the ⅛-inch thickness</li>
            <li>breadcrumbs</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>flour</li>
            <li>garlic powder</li>
            <li>ground pepper</li>
            <li>salt</li>
            <li>Oil for frying</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tenderize top round steaks to ⅛-inch thickness by pounding them with a meat mallet, rolling pin, or another heavy object. Make sure all steaks are approximately ⅛-inch thick.</li>
            <li>Add the steaks to a sheet pan and season on both sides with half of your salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Place breadcrumbs in a large bowl and mix garlic powder and your remaining salt and pepper into them until combined.</li>
            <li>In a medium mixing bowl, beat eggs.</li>
            <li>Add oil to a skillet over medium-high heat. You can safely test how hot the oil is by placing the end of a wooden spoon in the oil. If many bubbles form around the wood and start floating up, the oil is hot enough for frying.</li>
            <li>Dust steaks with flour. Dip in eggs, then dip in breadcrumbs. Fully coat all steak, pressing the breadcrumbs into the meat if necessary.</li>
            <li>Fry on both sides for 2-3 minutes a side until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Place on a plate with paper towels to drain the oil. Serve and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
