        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2Â½ kg meat flank steak, flap, skirt steak, tenderloin. But always choose the ribs and a cut of meat</li>
            <li>6 chorizo sausages</li>
            <li>400 g chinchulines chinchulines is a term that makes reference to the offal of the cow such as the small intestine, kidneys and sweetbread. Black pudding is usually considered in this group too</li>
            <li>2 lemons</li>
            <li>coarse salt</li>
            <li>marinade optional if using kidneys</li> 
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Before you start, soak the chorizos in bowl until you are ready to cook them. This is to prevent dryness after cooking.</li>
            <li>Make a fire using charcoal, wood and paper. This would probably take you around an hour.</li>
            <li>Once you have the fire ready, distribute the embers so you have a high heat and a low heat area. Sprinkle some salt on top of the embers to prevent the ashes from rising too much.</li>
            <li>Keep to the side a small additional fire going from where you can take embers to put in the main fire when needed.</li>
            <li>Put the meat on the grill, fat side down and let it cook for at least 40 min - one hour, turning the meat every 15 or 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the ribs on the grill. They are ready in 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the meat is ready, cut it in portions and put them in a large plate so everyone can choose what they want.</li>
        </ol>
